    <p> Hi everyone, I am currently working on a degree in computer science. I hope to eventually get a job either as a 
        software engineer or web developer. Some of my hobbies include playing tennis, photography, working out, and watching movies. 
        I used to work as a GeekSquad Agent at BestBuy which kinda cool because I got to mess around with computers and
         tech all day. Working there really showed me how interested I was in learning more the indepth mechanics of how computers
         worked and the software on them.
